# API Governance
This is the current outline for API governance, providing an overview of how APIs are moved forward.

- [**Documentation**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10394726/SzYUagbA?version=latest)
## Definition
This section is about evaluated the underlying definition of each API, providing working areas and artifacts that can be used across the API life cycle, allowing more of the surface area of API operations to be quantified, measured, and audited.

### Workspace
Establishing Postman workspaces for each API, making sure each individual API has a place to store it's API contract, and all the derivative collection. Providing a simple place for all stakeholders working on the API to work on and engage around the evolution of each Union Fashion API.

 - Is there a Postman workspace?
 - Is workspace named properly?

### Organization
Ensuring that each API belongs to the Union Fashion GitHub organization so it can be discovered, managed, and given the same resources and support as other APIs. Providing a single organizational umbrella for all Union Fashion APIs to be accessed and made available to other stakeholders, but also allowing the management of each API to be automated and integrated as part of other systems and processes.

 - Is there a GitHub organization?

### Repository
Verifying that each API has its own GitHub repository, providing a single location where all details about an API, allowing each API to be moved forward individually. Storing all details of an API within a single repository which shares a common structure with other APIs being delivered at Union Fashion, while allowing those details to be forked and integrated with wherever they are need as part of the life cycle of each API.

 - Is there a GitHub repository?

### APIs
Establishing the central truth of each API using the Postman API builder. Providing an API contract that can be used by all other areas of operations. Ensuring that there is a versioned, machine readable contract that defines each API, which can be used to generate other artifacts, and drive each stop along the API life cycle. Making sure that each API is consistently moving through a known API life cycle, which is something that enables this governance.

 - Is there a Postman API?
 - Is there an OpenAPI?
 - Is there a valid OpenAPI?

### Collections
This section is about establishing that there are the required derivatives of each API to execute upon other stops along the API life cycle, beginning with the life cycle itself, and then using this governance collection. Leveraging a handful of Postman collections to document, test, and quantify each API. Depending on a handful of collections to act as the gears of the API supply chain, driving different stops along the way.

 - Is there a life cycle collection?
 - Is there a governance collection?
 - Is there a documentation collection?
 - Is there a contract collection?
 - Is there a performance collection?
 - Is there a security collection?

### Environment
Postman environments are used to define the state of each API as it moves through the API lifecycle. Providing a machine readable definition that can be used to develop, stage, and put an API into production. In addition to the actual development and delivery of each aPI, these environments are used to guide each API along the API life cycle, and to realize this API governance vision.

 - Is there a development environment?
 - Is there a mock development environment?
 - Is there a production environment?
 - Is there a mock production environment?

### Owner
Making sure that each API has an owner, with up to date contact information so that there is always someone taking ownership over what is happening.

 - Is there a contact for the API?
 - Is there a contact name for this API?
 - Is there a contact email for the API?



## Design
This area addresses the most common tasks in which most API architects and developers think of when you mention API governance, but in reality it is just one component of a larger API governance strategy. But, the design of an API will dictate much of friction, or lack of friction across every other stop along the API life cycle, making it an important area to be investing in.

### Info
Making sure the most common information about each API is as complete as possible. Providing an area of each aPIs contract that describes the value each API delivers, standardizing what information is available about APIs across operations.


 - Does the name of the API meet requirements?
 - Does the description of the API meet requirements?

### Paths
This section is about evaluating each individual path being used to make API resources available. Helping make sure there is a consistent approach to the naming, structure, and scope of surface area of each API. Providing a well designed set of paths for getting at the valuable resources being made available via Union Fashion APIs.

 - Are paths using words?

### Methods
These governance requests are about interrogating each individual method of an API, helping set guidelines for how APIs are structured, using a common vocabulary for making data available. Defining the vocabulary of the Union Fashion operations, ensuring that we all speak the same language when it comes to working with Union Fashion digital assets.

### Parameters
For the methods that have parameters, there are a number of details that should be present. This area of governance is about making sure that path and query parameters are consistent across all APIs, employing the same patterns for how resources are defined, and made accessible via Union Fashion APIs.

### Request Bodies
For the methods that have request bodies, there are number of details that should exist. Providing guidelines for how the body is used across POST, PUT, PATCH, and other suitable methods. Ensuring that the payload of each API is consistently shaping each request, providing what is needed to shape the desired response.

### Responses
Moving beyond the request surface area of each API, this area of governance is about shaping the response for each individual API method. Helping establish the rules for how each response should be returned, providing a consistent experience across all APIs, reducing friction when it comes to integrating Union Fashion resources in internal, partner, and public applications.

 - Does GET, POST, PUT, and DELEETE exist for all resources?
 - Do all methods have summaries?
 - Do all methods have descriptions?
 - Do all methods have operation ids?
 - Do all methods have tags?

### Schema
Next, we want to drill further into the schema that is used as part of the request and response structure of each API. Being more organized about how schema are used as part of the request body, and returned with each response, making sure the schema used across the platform are part of a larger strategy for managing the structure of digital resources.

 - Do all schema have properties?
 - Do all schema properties have descriptions?



## Mocks
Mocked servers make it easier for each area of development, staging, and production of an API to be made more tangible, providing a shared representation of an API that can be used by stakeholders without actually having to have the API be fully deployed, and not being forced to work with live data and infrastructure. Making it mocking a sensible part of the governance of Union Fashion APIs.

 - Is there a mock development server?
 - Is there a mock production server?


## Development
This area is about moving an API from design to reality, ensuring that all the gears are in place for automating the creation of each API. Using the contract for the API to go beyond a static mock representation and deliver a development copy of the API contract, making an API more tangible, moving it towards production.

 - Is there a development server?
 - Is there a development stage defined with the API gateway? (COMING SOON)


## Production
This is the final stage that moves an API into production, establishing the official version of each API resource. Taking a fully tested API contract and making it available for use by consumers. Making the next iteration of a digital resource available for wider internal, partner, or public access.

 - Is there a production server?
 - Is there a production stage defined with the API gateway? (COMING SOON) Copy


## Management
This section deals with the management of each API, making sure each API is properly gated and only accessible by desired consumers. While also ensuring there is logging, reporting, and suitable amounts visibility into the access of each API being delivered as part of Union Fashion operations.

 - Is there an API plan?
 - Is there an API key?


## Testing
This area is for evaluating the testing of each API across all areas required as part of governance. Working to mamke sure that as much of the surface area of the API is tested as we possibly can.

### Contract Testing
 This section is for tracking on what contract testing is in place, making sure the contract of each API is being regularly tested.

 - Is there output from contract tests?
 - Did the API pass the contract tests?

### Security Testing
 This section is for tracking on what security testing is in place, making sure the security of each API is being regularly tested.

 - Is there output from security tests?
 - Did the API pass the security tests?

### Performance Testing
 This section is for tracking on what performance testing is in place, making sure the overall quality of service of each API is being regularly tested.

 - Is there output from performance tests?
 - Did the API pass the performance tests?



## Monitoring
This area is to help ensure there is the proper monitoring setup for the different collections that exist, ensuring that there is regular review of the key functions behind delivering this API.


 - Is there a contract testing collection monitor?
 - Is there a performance testing collection monitor?
 - Is there a security testing collection monitor?


## Support
These are the questions asked about the support of an API, ensuring that there are the proper support mechanisms in place.

### Road Map
This area is about making sure there is a road map for each API, revealing what the next steps are for each API.

 - Is GitHub issues setup for tracking roadmap?
 - How many road map entries are there?

### Issues
Making sure there is an active issue thread being shared, making sure consumers are kept aware of active issues with each API.

 - Is GitHub issues setup for tracking issues?
 - How many open issue entries are there? (COMING SOON)
 - How many close issue entries are there? (COMING SOON)

### Change Log
Relabeling things from the road map that get delivered, providing a change log of everything that has occurred to each API.

 - How many change log entries are there? (COMING SOON)
 - Is GitHub issues setup for tracking change log?



## LIcense
This aspect of governance is designed to evaluate the licensing, or lack of licensing that exists around each API. Making sure the API, and other aspects of operations are properly licensed for consumption by partner or 3rd party developers. Making sure that all APIs are legally protected, and reflect our wider API operational strategy.

 - Is there a license for the API??
 - How many road map entries are there? (COMING SOON) Copy


## Reporting
Finally, reporting is an important aspect of governance, ensuring that the API governance process is being applied to each API, and the outcomes are being recorded, shared, and considered. Providing observability over the API governance process, and always considering how the process can be expanded and improved upon.
